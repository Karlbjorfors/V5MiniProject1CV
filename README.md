# V5MiniProject1CV

A personal CV web page created using HTML and CSS. The project showcases Karl Björfors' professional experience, education, skills, and contact information in a clean and structured layout. The web page is responsive and can be easily converted to a PDF for professional use.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: The `index.html` dynamically loads the CV content from `cv.html`.
- **PDF Conversion**: The CV can be easily converted to a PDF while retaining the layout and styling.
- **Clean and Professional Layout**: Organized sections for goals, profile, work experience, education, skills, and contact information.

### Changes Made:
1. **Added File Structure**:
   - Included a tree structure to show the organization of the project files.

2. **Added Technologies Used**:
   - Listed the technologies used in the project: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

This makes the [README.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/7) more comprehensive and informative. Let me know if you need further updates!
